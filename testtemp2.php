                <p>For instance, if you consider the following example, the <code>.container</code> div has two parent elements: the <a href="../html-reference/html-body-tag.php"><code>&lt;body&gt;</code></a> and the <a href="../html-reference/html-html-tag.php"><code>&lt;html&gt;</code></a> element. And we all know that the default value of the <a href="../css-reference/css-height-property.php"><code>height</code></a> property is <code>auto</code>, so if we also set the height of <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> elements to 100%, the resulting height of the container div becomes equal the 100% height of the browser window.</p>
